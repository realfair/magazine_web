&lt;p&gt;<b>Apple's newest iPhone models</b> -- the snappily-named iPhone XS (that's &quot;ten S&quot;) and iPhone XS Max -- are hitting stores around the world on Friday (officially knocking the iPhone X out of Apple's lineup in the process), and Sydney was one of the first cities to get a bite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowds queued outside the Apple Sydney store on George Street in the early hours on Friday, waiting to get their hands on the iPhone XS and larger XS Max -- devices offering incremental upgrades on last year's iPhone X, with virtually the same hardware appearing in the two different-sized handsets.&lt;/p&gt;";
